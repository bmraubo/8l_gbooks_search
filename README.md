Test Assessment for 8 Light

Command line application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books and construct a reading list.

This application should allow you to:

Type in a query and display a list of 5 books matching that query.

Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company.

A user should be able to select a book from the five displayed to save to a “Reading List”

View a “Reading List” with all the books the user has selected from their queries -- this is a local reading list and not tied to Google Books’s account features.
